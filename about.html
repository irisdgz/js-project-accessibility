                    <p>I enjoy staying active and creative, whether it’s going for walks, 
                      working out, or taking on one of my woodworking or home renovation projects. 
                      I like keeping busy and appreciate seeing the results of my efforts. 
                      Much of my free time is spent with my pets my dog Maya, my cat Dessie, and my rabbit Pampam. 
                      When I get a quiet moment, I like to relax with a bit of gaming.</p>

        <p>A Disney enthusiast who loves spending time with my friends and family, and enjoying life with my son.
          My original plan was to become a vocal coach, but life took me in a different direction and now I’m working my way into the tech world.
          Also, one of my most fun work experiences was when I worked as a terminal operator at Schenker, where I got to drive forklifts all day.
