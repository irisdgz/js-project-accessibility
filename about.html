                  <p>I enjoy staying active and creative, whether it‚Äôs going for walks, 
                    working out, or taking on one of my woodworking or home renovation projects. 
                    I like keeping busy and appreciate seeing the results of my efforts. 
                    Much of my free time is spent with my pets my dog Maya, my cat Dessie, and my rabbit Pampam. 
                    When I get a quiet moment, I like to relax with a bit of gaming.</p>

            <p>Growing up between cultures in Sweden turned me into a true third-culture kid. 
          My impulsiveness somehow led me to coding ‚Äî which I feel can be painfully hard many times.
          It‚Äôs a big career shift from my previous path, but the challenge of building something new from scratch is 
          pretty awsome. When my brain needs a break, I relax by scrolling through properties beyond my budget üòÇ.

            <p>A Disney enthusiast who loves spending time with my friends and family, and enjoying life with my son. 
              My original plan was to become a vocal coach, but life took me in a different direction and now I‚Äôm working my way into the tech world. 
              My favorite food is anything with feta cheese in it. And If you know Dory‚Äôs color in Finding Nemo, you know my favorite color.

            <p>Born and raised in Gothenburg but moved to the north in 2019 when I was 24 years young, wanted real winters and amazing nature. I get to see the northern lights and ski/skate as much as I want. Although I'm not an artist myself I know that the year I was born the legend of Bob Ross passed away.
            I Have really loved my 6 years here so far.</p>
